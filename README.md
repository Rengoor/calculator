Odin Project's Calculator Project
UI Design inspired by MDBootstrap

The entire project is divided into three stages:
1. Simple, one digit calculations.
2. Prevention of potential bugs.
3. Style and design of the calculator.

Simple one digit calculations:
    The goal was to make sure all the number and operator buttons work normally and that values are
    successfully fetched from the display, and are displayed from our results.
    This initial stage reinforced my knowledge of wiring up Javascript, to the point that just reading some of the criteria would pop up code in my mind to solve the problems as I read them.
    In terms of learning something new, not much was there to learn here except how powerful console.logs are when trying to check whether a certain variable is stored properly.

Prevention of potential bugs:
    Here was when I implemented multiple digit calculations and ensuring calculations can be carried out without the press of the equal button. Other bugs were taken care of to including dividing by zero and pressing of the equal button without any number entered.
    This was when I learned the most. I improved my debugging skills and for the very first time, I was continously asking for help which I found myself improving in by asking the right questions and providing the right information. Any potential bug fix would lead to new tools of thought processes being unlocked which I will use to solve future problems.

Style and design of the calculator:
    This task was simple but the branching version control skills and bootstrap skills taught here were immensely underrated. Using ui inspiration from mdbootstrap.com, I completed this ui and refine my css skills.
